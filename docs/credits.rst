This is at least a partial list of people that have contributed to the
Mys project. It is sorted by name.

- `Erik Moqvist <https://github.com/eerimoq>`_

- `Fredrik Hallenberg <https://github.com/megahallon>`_

- `Simon Bordeyne <https://github.com/dogeek>`_

And of course, the Python language, which Mys has taken a lot of
inspiration (and some code) from. And as you probably know, pythons
eats mice...
