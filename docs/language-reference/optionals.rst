Optionals
---------

.. warning::

   Optionals are not yet implemented.

You use optionals in situations where a value may be absent. An
optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and
you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isnâ€™t a
value at all.

Add ``?`` after a type to make it optional.

See
https://github.com/mys-lang/mys/blob/main/examples/wip/optionals/src/main.mys
for an example.
